Now that we see ourselves as one Earth, the next step of human expansion is into the solar system.  A huge key to that step will be the mining of asteroids, and the moving of manufacturing into space. My intent is to create a website that taps into the excitement this idea can generate in a large segement of the population, and use that energy to help catapult concept and implementation into the human consciousness. This allows for tie-ins to a plethora of computer science concepts, the most obvious being AI and robotics.   In  addition to the computer science concepts, new and intriguing economic options will have to be implemented to achieve the expansion.   The website:   www.asteroidvaluebuilder.com will make it's focus on three main categories.   1.  educational and entertaining.   This will create imeadiate value.   2.  Cashing of knowledge and ideas that are in the cutting edge of the endeavor.   This will lead to economic opportunity, and the natural value of a knowledge base.  3.  It will attempt to stay ahead of the financial and legal changes that will occur to grow the industries.   This will allow the site to harness crowd sourcing of the common man, to participate in what would be a hugely lucrative endeavor with the buying/investing power of a large group.
